# ESEP_ExtraCredit
Instructions to run: 
- Open main.cpp in a compiler or equivalent setup of your choice and run the main method - the main method contains the example code from the final part of the assignment rubric to demonstrate the functionality of each of the methods required to be a part of this relational database.

In order to make this extra credit into a fully-fledged assignment in the future, my advice would be to develop test cases that specifically inform students whether their code works to the extent that the graders of the assignment are looking for. As things stand, I am fairly sure that my code functions perfectly and that it fulfills the requirements of the assignment, but given that the rubric is open-ended in terms of how to develop the database code, I can't be 100% sure that I have successfully met expectations for this assignment. I do think that allowing students to complete this assignment in a programming language of their choice is a good thing, but test cases which verify that each required method of the database functions correctly or at least more specific instructions on the expectations that the code needs to meet would be much appreciated to improve the assignment for future semesters. Outside of that, I had no further feedback for this extra credit and was pleased with the requirements for every other aspect of the assignment.
